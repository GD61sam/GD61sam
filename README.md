Hi There! I am Sam McKinney!

I am a Vancouver, BC based programmer. I am most knowledgeable in Unity development but also enjoy working in Unreal Engine.
I am interested in Gameplay, Systems, Tools and AI programming and I am currently learning C ++.
I am looking to enter a programming role at a company that encourages learning and progressing forward.
I hope to one day enter a Tech lead position.
